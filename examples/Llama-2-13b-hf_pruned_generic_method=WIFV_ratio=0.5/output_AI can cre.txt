AI can do 90% of a human's work in a fraction of the time and at a much lower cost. This allows businesses to focus on other areas, such as innovative product development, marketing campaigns, quality-of-life improvements, and cost reductions for consumable goods—all of which increase profits and, in turn, stimulate the economy. The result is more jobs, which are needed to sustain the population and create more jobs, and so on. This is the basis of the Keystone Effect, which states that one job creates 1.5 to 1.75 jobs, depending on the industry in which it is created.
In the long term, it is estimated that the Keystone Effect will result in a net increase in jobs of 2.25 billion by 2040—an astonishing 40 percent increase in the world's population. This is a conservative estimate, as it does not take into account the fact that many jobs require more than one job to be fulfilled, or jobs that are created as a result of the first job (e.g., a car needs to be manufactured, which in turn creates jobs to manufacture tires, etc.).
The world's population is currently estimated to be 7.2 billion, and it is expected to reach 10.4 billion by 2030. This means
