McDonald's Corp. (MCD) is a fast food restaurant company with over 35,000 restaurants in 100 countries. It is the largest employer in the United States with over 1.5 million employees, and the second largest private employer in the world after Walmart.
In 1948, the company was founded by two brothers, Dick and Mac McDonald, who opened a restaurant in San Bernardino, California. The restaurant was named "McDonald's" after the brothers' father, who was a McDonald's franchisee in New Hampshire.
In 1955, Ray Kroc, an entrepreneur from Chicago, purchased the rights to the McDonald's name and system from the McDonald brothers and began to expand the chain throughout the United States. He is credited with introducing the "Speedee Service System" which allowed customers to order food from the counter and have it prepared in the kitchen, reducing wait times and increasing productivity.
The first McDonald's restaurant in Canada opened in Vancouver in 1968, and the first one in Australia followed in 1974. In 1982, the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange and has been a member of the S&P 500 since 1987.
