Prompt: What is McDonald's?
Generated: What is McDonald's?
It is a small inn in an alley, a hundred yards or two from the gates. The tavern's walls are thick, and it has a steeply pitched roof. Above the door there is carved a dragon's flicked beak, with the words _Bow of Arrows_ carved in the sill.
Inside, the tavern is large and well lit by daylight. There are three stairways leading to the north, all of which are occupied by men in armor. The tavern's name is the Silver Goat, for it was owned by a dwarf who died in the war against Scarraphe's orcs. The sign of the goat hangs over the door, and it is a common sight in the city.
Above the head of the Dragon Tavern hangs a carcavelle of three dragon bones, one of which bears the sigil of an uncrowned dragon ridden by the Dragon Kings of the Isles of the Deadly Seast.
The tavern is run by an eldwar of stout proportions, with gray eyes and a beard that grew down to his eardrocks. He sits in a chair carved from an oak tree, and his companions are a tripe of halflings, all wearing silver helmets.
